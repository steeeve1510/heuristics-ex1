\section*{2. big-M proof}
Let
\begin{align*}
N &= \{(i,j) \: | \: e_{i,j} \in E \wedge d_{i,j} \leq 0 \} \\
P &= \{(i,j) \: | \: e_{i,j} \in E \wedge d_{i,j} \geq 0 \} \\
w_N &= \lvert \sum_{(i,j) \in N} d_{i,j} \rvert \\ 
w_P &= \sum_{(i,j) \in P} d_{i,j} \\ 
\textit{M} &= max( w_N , w_P ) + 1
\end{align*}

For every feasible solution the sum of it weights has a value between $w_N$ and $w_P$. Any infeasible solution $X$ will consist of zero or more existing edges. This part shall be called $A$ with the some of the weight $w_A$. If no existing edge is chosen $w_A$ will be $0$. $w_A$ is always between $w_N$ and $w_P$. Additionally $X$ has $i$ non-existing edges, with $i>0$. As by definition those non-existing edges will be considered with a weight of $M$.

So $X$ has a weight $w_X$ of:
\begin{align*}
w_X = w_A + i * M \geq w_N + i * M \geq w_N + M
\end{align*}

By definition of $M$,  $w_N + M$ must greater than $w_P$. Therefore we can conclude that every infeasible solution has a worse objective value than any feasible solution.
