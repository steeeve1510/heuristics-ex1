\section*{9. VND}
The VND was implemented as proposed in the slides. The VND uses the three neighborhood structures in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 2-opt
  \item 2.5-opt
  \item 3-opt
\end{enumerate}
Changing the order of the structures changes the solution quality a bit. Because 3-opt produces a lot better solutions than the other two, the solutions get better if 3-opt runs more often. We have chosen to keep the order mentioned above, because the search space for 3-opt is very large and therefore the runtime gets worse.
