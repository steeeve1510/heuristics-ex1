\section*{1. Can you think of a real-world application for this problem?}

A possible real world application could be a heating system. The heating system is designed for a building where different sources of heat are distributed, but also want to keep other building rooms warm. The sources of heat could be computer servers that have some type of liquid cooling. 
The CB-TSP problem would then find a way of laying the pipes, where the weight of each edge states the amount of heat added to or extracted from the system when connecting two rooms, and wants to keep the liquid running inside the pipe system at certain constant temperature.
