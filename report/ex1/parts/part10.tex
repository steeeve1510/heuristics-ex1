\section*{10. Simulated Annealing}
A simulated annealing algorithm  is implemented as proposed in the slides. The algorithm generates a solution which is chosen if it is better than the current one or a random criterion based on the current \textit{temperature} is met. It stops when the temperature reaches certain low point or 15 minutes of CPU time have elapsed.

The initial temperature $ T_i $ was $ 1000 $ and the cooling factor $ \alpha $ chosen was $ 0.95 $. In each temperature level $ |V|*(|V|-1) $ iterations is spent until cooling again. As neighborhood structure we chose 3-opt. The results are shown in section 13.
