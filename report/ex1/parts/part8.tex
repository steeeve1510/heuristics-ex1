\section*{8. GRASP}
GRASP is implemented as proposed in the slides. Like local search the number of iterations since the last successful improvements is the termination criteria and can be configured. In our example maximal 100 unsuccessful improvements have been chosen. For the neighborhood structure 3-opt with \textit{next improvement} step has been chosen. For the results each instance consists of 10 runs with a maximum CPU time limit of 90 seconds.
