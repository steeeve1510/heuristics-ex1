\section*{5. Random construction heuristic}
The random construction heuristic chooses two random cities and considers those cities as a tour. It picks a random city out of those which weren't visited yet and inserts this city into the existing tour at the position which worsens the objective value the least. The different solutions are generated by picking different cities. The algorithm is currently completely randomized, because there is no restriction which cities to choose. The degree of randomization could be reduced by picking only those cities which will worsen the objective value only by a defined amount.

Each instance has been run 20 times.
